0–3 sec — INTRODUCTION  
In the soft morning light, a wide shot reveals Atukuzwa standing in a lush, green field in Kilolo North District. The earth is rich and dark beneath her feet, and dew glistens on the leaves. In the background, a small group of farmers tend to their own plots, the landscape framed by distant rolling hills.

3–6 sec — ACTION  
A close-up focuses on Atukuzwa's hands as she skillfully tills the soil with a hoe, her movements steady and practiced. The texture of the earth shifts under her touch, her fingers occasionally brushing against tender young shoots, showcasing her connection to the land.

6–9 sec — CHALLENGE  
The camera gently pans to reveal a section of the field where the soil appears drier and less fertile. A few worn-out tools lie on the ground nearby, hinting at the ongoing struggle for resources and the challenge of maintaining productive land.

9–12 sec — HOPE  
The camera shifts back to Atukuzwa, capturing her as she pauses to wipe her brow, a gentle smile of determination on her face. Sunlight streams through the clouds, illuminating the field, as a fellow farmer approaches, sharing a nod of encouragement, symbolizing community strength and shared goals.
