0–3 sec — INTRODUCTION  
A wide establishing shot of Mauren Milena's nursery at dawn. Soft golden light filters through the leaves of various ornamental plants. The nursery is lined with rows of potted plants, with a rustic wooden table displaying gardening tools and bags of compost in the background.

3–6 sec — ACTION  
Close-up of Mauren's hands gently planting a new sapling into a pot, fingers pressing soil around the roots with care. The camera captures her focused expression and the rhythmic motion of her hands as she reaches for a watering can.

6–9 sec — CHALLENGE  
A slow pan reveals a section of the nursery with worn-out plant stands and a limited variety of plants, hinting at the need for more supplies and better displays. Mauren pauses briefly, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand, showing mild fatigue.

9–12 sec — HOPE  
The camera shifts to a gentle handheld movement capturing Mauren's soft smile as she stands back to admire the newly planted row. A customer enters the frame, browsing the plants, and the sunlight brightens, casting warm, hopeful shadows across the nursery.
