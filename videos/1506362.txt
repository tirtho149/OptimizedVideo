0–3 sec — INTRODUCTION  
In the early morning light of Korca, the camera captures a wide shot of Melsi in his expansive vegetable field. The rich, earthy textures of soil and rows of green plants stretch to the horizon. Tree nuts stand tall in the background, their leaves gently rustling in the dawn breeze.

3–6 sec — ACTION  
The camera transitions to a close-up of Melsi's hands as he carefully tends to a young potato plant. His hands are weathered and strong, using a small spade to loosen the soil. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on his focused expression.

6–9 sec — CHALLENGE  
A slow pan reveals Melsi's worn tools, showing their age and heavy use. The camera subtly highlights the empty section of land, waiting for the new nut trees, hinting at the limited resources he currently faces.

9–12 sec — HOPE  
The camera gently shifts to Melsi looking up from his work, a soft, determined smile on his face as sunlight brightens the field. A couple of nut tree saplings in pots are ready to be planted, symbolizing his hope for future growth and stability.
