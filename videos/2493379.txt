Wide establishing shot of Yafesi in his lush banana garden during early morning light. The sun casts soft golden hues across the vibrant green leaves. In the background, a modest rural landscape with a few distant houses and rolling hills is visible.

3–6 sec — ACTION  
Close-up of Yafesi’s hands gently spreading dark, rich mulch around the base of a banana plant. His fingers move methodically, working the soil with care, a small spade lies beside him, glistening with dew.

6–9 sec — CHALLENGE  
The camera slowly pans to reveal the confined space of the garden, bordered by neighboring plots. The banana plants are thriving, but the limited area is evident, hinting at the challenge of overpopulation.

9–12 sec — HOPE  
A gentle handheld shot captures Yafesi standing upright, wiping sweat from his brow, and looking towards the horizon. A slight, hopeful smile spreads across his face as sunlight breaks through the clouds, illuminating the garden and symbolizing potential growth.
